docxtemplater
=============

Adapted from https://docxtemplater.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#node

Simple container that can be used to run node.js apps.

Usage:
```
docker run --rm -it -v .:/work andybrucenet/docxtemplater ./myfile.js
```

That should run the file with docxtemplater support.

That is all.
